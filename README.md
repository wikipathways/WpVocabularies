# WikiPathways Vocabularies

WikiPathways vocabularies for RDF representation. These ontologies are
written up as HTML documents with embedded triples in the RDFa format.

Currently, two ontologies have sources in this repository:

* The WikiPathways WP Ontology: http://vocabularies.wikipathways.org/wp#
* The WikiPathways GPML Vocabulary: http://vocabularies.wikipathways.org/gpml#

This repo also has WikiPathways JSON-LD contexts, located in the "./jsonld/" directory. These can be used to describe JSON data from WikiPathways, [like this](https://json-ld.org/playground/#startTab=tab-expanded&json-ld=%7B%22%40context%22%3A%22https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.rawgit.com%2Fwikipathways%2FWpVocabularies%2Fdebdb40%2Fjsonld%2Fpvjs.jsonld%22%2C%22%40id%22%3A%22WP586%22%2C%22%40type%22%3A%22wp%3APathway%22%2C%22contains%22%3A%22Metabolite%22%7D&context=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.rawgit.com%2Fwikipathways%2FWpVocabularies%2Fdebdb40e0bf5e85bffc0975eb90d442020a4d440%2Fjsonld%2Fpvjs.jsonld).
